Two of my incredibly talented dancer friends embarked on a mission to travel the world learning and teaching dance. Indeed, they traveled many places and creative lovely and inventive dance videos wherever they went. I contributed a basic website to help lend their project a centralized presence on the internet. Mira and Robin have since diverted their attention to a new effort called *The Duet Project*, and I'm excited to see what sublime creations they will issue forth.

As for the old website, all my fancy CSS work is gone but most of the content still exists thanks to the Wayback Machine internet archive of [transcontinentaldance.org](http://web.archive.org/web/20080702030005/http://www.transcontinentaldance.org/).

Also for posterity, the source of the pages are on [GitHub](https://github.com/lukeorland/transcontinentaldance.org).
